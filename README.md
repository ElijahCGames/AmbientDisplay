This projects broad goal was to create a simple and understandable way to visualize/physicalize weather data, specifically perspiration (using the pump) and temperature (using the LED.) This was created in the context of an exhibit exploring different climate regions and how climate change is effecting those regions. Using "the weather machine" guests can explore how weather is different between regions and how that has changed in the last 50 years. The intended audience for this piece are 5th-7th graders in the United States; those with basic knowledge of US geography and weather features. The goal for the audience is to instill the idea that climate and weather are connected, but weather is a local phenomenon based on a region's climate. This leads to questions of how we define climate regions, what climate the guest lives in, and how climate is changing in a guests local area.

This project was made for Physical Computing at Northeastern University.
